<h1 align="center">Abstract</h1>


Credit scores allow individuals and businesses to be able to take loans, many of which
stimulate the economy, allowing ideas to be formed into products and services, and
giving the opportunity for people to own their own place of residence. The hypothesis
of this study was that IQ scores and financial literacy scores are positively correlated
with credit scores, and that higher financial literacy confidence scores coupled with
low financial literacy scores are negatively correlated to credit scores, thus allowing
the possibility to create an algorithm to predict credit scores of people who do not
have credit scores. A survey was used to collect the data in this study, specifically IQ
scores, financial literacy scores, financial literacy confidence scores, and credit scores.
96 participants, aged 18 and over, were recruited through opportunistic sampling and
consented   to   take   part   in   the   survey.   Analysis   consisted   of   correlation   charts,
heatmaps, scatter plots, multivariable regression, to find patterns in the data. The
results show that the combination of IQ scores, financial literacy scores, and financial literacy self-confidence scores, is strongly positively correlated to credit scores. A
multivariable regression model was created, with an accuracy of 74.19%. An Artificial Neural Network was created, with an accuracy of 65.51%.
